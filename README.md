# React Redux Ecommerce Store

This project is a custom-built e-commerce store using React and Redux. It incorporates a fake API to simulate interactions with a backend server. The store provides basic functionalities such as browsing products, adding items to the cart, and placing orders.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm start`.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: Predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
- React Redux: Official React bindings for Redux.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client used to make API requests.

These dependencies are specified in the `package.json` file and will be automatically installed when running `npm install`.

## Usage

The application provides a user-friendly interface to browse products and make purchases. Users can perform the following actions:

- View a list of available products.
- Add items to the cart.
- Remove items from the cart.
- Update the quantity of items in the cart.
- Place an order.

The project incorporates a fake API service that simulates interactions with a backend server. The data is fetched asynchronously and displayed in the application.
